![RoamIO Logo](app/src/main/res/drawable-v24/ReadmeLogo.png)

RoamIO is a mobile application developed as a part of the Mobile Application Development project during our 3rd year of college. It serves as a travel blog platform that allows travel enthusiasts to share their adventures and experiences through blog posts. The app is built using Java and Android Studio and integrates Firebase for Google authentication and OTP-based mobile number authentication. Additionally, static data is loaded into the app using a ready-made API from Bitbucket.

Bitbucket API Used: https://bitbucket.org/dmytrodanylyk/travel-blog-resources/raw/3eede691af3e8ff795bf6d31effb873d484877be/blog_articles.json

## Features

- User Registration and Login: Users can create accounts or log in using Google authentication or mobile number verification via OTP.
- Blog Viewing: Users can browse and read blog posts shared by others.
- Static Data Integration: The app fetches static data from a Bitbucket API to display additional travel information.
